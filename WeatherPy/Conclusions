Based on the random sample of cities across the globe, the data shows:
1. There is a clear correlation between closeness to the equator and temperature. This is more evident in the cities of the north hemisphere, as there were very few observations in the south hemisphere below latitude -60. However, in both hemispheres is clear that temperature goes down as the citi is farther from the equator
2. There doesnt seem to be a correlation between latitude and humidity or cloudiness. In both scatter plots, there are high and low levels of humidity or cloudiness regardaless of the distance from the equator. This is probably true, as humidity is probable more correlated with other geographic factors such as altitude
3. Wind speed did not have a clear correlation with latitude; however, the data also shows that the cities that are farther from the equator, tend to have higher wind speed levels. For example, all cities with winds over 25mph were at least 20 degrees away from the equator, and the cities that were father from the equator all have wind speed above 5 mph
